Contains code used for the Paper-based Artwork Analysis Project.

The primary analysis scripts to use are the 'En-face Analysis.py' and 'B-scan Analysis.py' python files in combination with 'analysisFunctionGallery.py', this will allow you to complete any OCT scan analysis that is saved as a .TIF file for multiple OCT systems.
